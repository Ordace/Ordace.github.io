what is intelligence
    Intelligence is a piano, the world presses the keys on her, and she responds to the world with a song.
what is computer    
    Computer is the elementary form of intelligence, which can be seen as the brain of intelligence.
history of computer
    to know the outcome faster   
    from hand-driven computer to power-driven computer
problem of early computer(controlled by relay)
    large
    slow
    Mechanical wear
    cost     
solution by vacuum tube
    negative electrode
    positive electrode
    middle electrode(negative or positive)
problem of vacuum tube
    fragile(glass)
    still too large
    still low phsical efficiency
solution by semiconduct tube(transistor)
    replace the middle electrode by semiconduct
logic gate
    not(0)=1;not(1)=0
    and(1,1)=1,and(0,x)=0
    or(1,x)=1,or(0,0)=0
    xor(0,0)=xor(1,1)=0,xor(1,0)=xor(0,1)=1

    character: limit data(string)
ALU
    logic unit(4 bits)
        input signal 1000
        activate related math unit(subtract)
    math unit(8bits)
        input signal A(00100111)
